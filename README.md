# Maintanance Log

Imagine your appartment is your spaceship and you're the captain! You have lots of maintance tasks you need to keep track of: laundry, watering plants, vacuum cleaning... With Maintance Log, keeping track of your tasks is as easy as admiring the stars in the sky! But be careful, procrastinating on maintenance will result in yellow or even red alert and endanger your ship! Allow auto-destruction and try to get as far away from Earth as possible! Each day without yellow alert or red alert will add another light year on your journey through the galaxy.
